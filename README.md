## Development

### File Structure
**UI** components should reside in the `src/components` folder.

While **Page** components should reside in the `src/pages` folder. A page component is responsible for the grouping and layout of varios different components into a page. Also responsible for any logic around the communication between the different components, the rest of the application (i.e. routing), and with the external world.
